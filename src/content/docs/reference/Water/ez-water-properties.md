## Exclusion Zone Water: Properties and Controversies

### Introduction

Water has long intrigued researchers with its life-giving properties and ubiquity across biology. Yet many of its molecular behaviors remain only partially understood. In particular, probing the structure and interactions of water molecules near surfaces and interfaces continues to reveal new complexes beyond the familiar bulk liquid.

One set of intriguing findings in this area involves the characterization of exclusion zone (EZ) water layers next to hydrophilic surfaces. First reported by Gerald Pollack and colleagues at the University of Washington in the 2000s, EZ water refers to an extensive ordering of water molecules hypothesized to occur adjacent to hydrophilic structures, such as hydrogels, polymers, and biological tissues.

Pollack et al. found that these interfacialexclusion zones can extend out hundreds of microns from the originating surface. Within these zones, dissolved solutes, particles, and gases are selectively excluded, forming nearly pure water layers devoid of suspendable materials. This finding gave rise to the term “exclusion zone” water.

In addition to selective exclusion effects, EZ water appears to exhibit unique properties including increased viscosity, layered hexagonal structure, and negative charge relative to bulk water. The exact mechanisms behind EZ formation and resulting attributes remain debated within the scientific community.

Research continues into validating and expanding on Pollack’s initial observations and proposed models. EZ water represents an intriguing frontier in understanding the complex organizational potentials of water molecules given appropriate nanoscale boundary constraints and electrochemical environments.

This paper will review the reported properties of EZ water, current theories advanced, debates and controversies around the mechanisms, and directions for future research. Ongoing studies aim to provide deeper insight into water’s many anomalous behaviors through elucidating the nature of exclusion zone formation dynamics.

### II. Reported Properties of EZ Water

Research by Pollack and others has ascribed several characteristic properties to EZ water layers, including:

Layered, ordered structure - EZ water is proposed to exhibit a more structured, ordered arrangement compared to bulk water. Molecular modeling and diffraction studies suggest water molecules within the EZ organize into layered sheets with hexagonal packing arrangements. This contrasts with the randomized three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network predominant in ordinary bulk water.

Charge separation and accumulation - Charge differences have been measured between EZ water and bulk water, with EZ layers acquiring a net negative charge. Possible mechanisms include an excess of negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH-) or increased electron density aligning along the hexagonal sheets. This charge separation may be supported by the structured EZ environment.  

Increased viscosity - EZ water has been observed to demonstrate significantly higher viscosity and resistance to flow compared to bulk water. This may be attributable to stronger hydrogen bonding between the ordered water molecules within the EZ structure. The reduced entropy makes EZ water more viscous.

Selective solute exclusion - Dissolved ions, molecules, colloids, and other materials present in bulk water are dramatically excluded from EZ layers. This selective exclusion gave rise to the name exclusion zone water. Only bare water molecules appear able to penetrate and align within the ordered EZ domains.

Light absorption - EZ water shows enhanced absorption of radiant energy, particularly in the UV spectrum. This may result from electronic transitions or resonance facilitated by the aligned EZ structure. The absorbed photons can dissipate into heat or emission.

Reactivity changes - The structured EZ environment has been proposed to alter the rates and equilibria of chemical reactions occurring within the zone compared to bulk water conditions. However, effects appear highly specific so far.

Here is a draft of the next section covering some of the proposed theories and models aimed at explaining the properties of exclusion zone (EZ) water:

### III. Proposed Theories and Models of EZ Water

The unusual characteristics exhibited by EZ water have prompted multiple theoretical propositions to account for the driving factors behind EZ formation and resulting properties. Some leading ideas include:

Hexagonal packing models - The layered, ordered structure prompting selective exclusion has been modeled as water molecules arranging in hexagonal packing conformations within the EZ. This allows optimal hydrogen bonding with restricted configurations compared to bulk water. The hexagonal sheets create a matrix rejecting solutes.

Electronic alignments - Aligning of electronic orbitals and transitions between molecular layers has been suggested as a factor enabling charge accumulation within EZ zones. Quantum coherence providing delocalization could stabilize separated charges. The optical absorption may also relate to aligned electronic resonances.

Surface-induced ordering - Interfaces with hydrophilic surfaces appear pivotal to initiating EZ formation. Interactions with surface charge groups is hypothesized to anchor and template ordered water layering. The surface polarity also orients water molecules through hydrogen bonding.

Gel matrix effects - EZ water was first studied next to hydrogels like Nafion. The polymer mesh-like structure may assist water ordering and charge separation. The matrix rejects solutes while allowing water and selective ions to permeate and align.

Quantum coherent domains - EZ water has been proposed to exhibit quantum scale coherence similar to Fröhlich condensates. This could enable long-range dipole alignment and information transfer supporting the layered structure. Quantum effects may also explain EZ stability out to significant distances from the originating surface.

These represent some attempts at providing physical mechanisms for the induction of layered, charged, exclusive water structures with unique properties adjacent to specific surfaces. Further theoretical and experimental research is needed to determine which factors are necessary and sufficient for generating stable EZ zones.

Here is a draft of the next section providing some critical analysis and discussing controversies surrounding exclusion zone (EZ) water research:

### IV. Critical Analysis and Controversies

While the experimental reports on EZ water are intriguing, a number of critical questions and controversies remain regarding the interpretation of results and proposed models. Some issues debated in the literature include:

Reproducibility challenges - Some studies have had trouble reproducing key effects like large EZ zone sizes or charge separation under similar conditions as initial reports. Difficulty replicating findings raises questions.

Ambiguity over exact mechanisms - The specific molecular and physical processes governing EZ formation remain ambiguous.Competing theories exist for EZ structure, charge genesis, and drivers.

Questions about measurement techniques - Certain specialized tools like Nafion scanning electrodes used in seminal studies have drawn scrutiny regarding artifacts and alternative explanations for results.

Alternative explanations for results - Skeptics argue observed phenomena may stem from known interfacial effects rather than novel EZ physics. Conventional ion accumulation or structuring could potentially explain aspects.

Lack of independent validation - Most EZ water research has been conducted by Pollack’s group.More independent confirmation is needed, along with exploring broader conditions.

Premature conclusions - Some contend that definitive conclusions about properties, structure, and origin of EZ zones are premature given major gaps that remain in understanding.

While not discounting EZ observations, these critiques emphasize the need for further rigorous and replicable experiments to address open questions. Broader interdisciplinary collaboration could aid validation efforts. Critical analysis helps refine ideas and improve collective understanding of structured interfacial water layers.

Here is a draft of the next section covering some potential research directions and open questions surrounding exclusion zone (EZ) water:

### V. Research Directions and Future Questions

Addressing the current unknowns and controversies related to EZ water will require expanded research efforts. Some promising directions that could yield further insight include:

- Developing improved EZ characterization methods - Advancing techniques like custom microscopy, spectrometry, and microfluidics tailored to probing nanoscale dynamics at water-surface interfaces.

- Exploring industrial applications if validated - Leveraging the unique properties of structured EZ water layers could motivate innovations if conclusively demonstrated. Applications from lubricants to batteries have been proposed.

- Connections to other water anomalies - Comparing EZ findings with other unusual water behaviors like low-density liquid phases or critical-point phenomena may reveal deeper principles.

- Theoretical modeling and simulations - Computational chemistry and physics modeling could help determine possible water ordering motifs, transition states, and stabilize factors responsible for generating and sustaining EZ layers.

- Interdisciplinary collaboration - Researchers from fields like physical chemistry, biophysics, materials science, and nanotechnology will likely provide useful perspectives on structuring phenomena in EZ zones.

In addition to these avenues, key open questions about EZ water include:

- What is the exact molecular conformation within EZ layers? How are charge, electrons, and protons distributed?

- What thermodynamic and kinetic factors allow EZ layers to overcome entropy and persist at distance from surfaces?

- Can EZ formation dynamics be predicted and tuned based on surface properties like topography, charge, and hydrophobicity?

- What communication mechanisms allow coordinated structure across macroscale EZ zones?

- Can EZ water effects be conclusively separated from other known interfacial phenomena?

Focused efforts to answer these foundational questions will help establish the validity, explanatory power, and potential applications of the intriguing but controversial concept of exclusion zone water.

### VI. Conclusion

The discovery of exclusion zone water layers has opened up new directions in understanding the complex organizational behaviors exhibited by water molecules under specific interfacial conditions. While much remains unknown, initial observations indicate water next to certain hydrophilic surfaces can develop into extensive ordered domains with unique properties like charge accumulation and selective solute exclusion.

However, significant questions remain regarding the proposed models and mechanisms behind EZ formation, structure, and resulting attributes. Effects have proven difficult to reproduce consistently, and skepticism persists about some conclusions drawn in highly cited reports. Independent validation remains limited to date.

Moving forward, further research is needed to uncover the precise molecular and physical drivers enabling EZ generation and stabilization. Improved experimental techniques tailored to interfacial water nanodynamics can help advance understanding. Broader collaboration between fields concerned with water’s many anomalous behaviors may reveal deeper common principles.

With refined models and robust empirics, cautiously elucidated facets of EZ water could find fruitful applications in membrane science, microfluidics, surface engineering, and other fields. However, the level of current evidence is likely insufficient to support definitive claims about industrial utility. Patience and rigor are warranted to unpack the complexities of water’s organizational preferences at nanoscales.

While many open questions remain, the phenomenon of exclusion zone formation highlights water’s continued power to surprise. As tools and models improve, interdisciplinary science may uncover new facets of water’s hidden life in organizing collective molecular behaviors. EZ research marks an intriguing step on the long journey toward fully illuminating water’s secrets.
