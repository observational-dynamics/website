title: Vortex Propulsion Engine
description: A proposed device to propel vehicles and devices using imploding vortices of exclusion zone (EZ) water.

The Vortex Propulsion Engine would utilize imploding vortices in hydrophilic chambers to propel vehicles and devices by harnessing the momentum of structured EZ water flows.

It consists of a vortex chamber with tangential inlets that create a swirling vortex of water or aqueous solution. As the vortex intensifies, a point of cavitation is reached causing an implosive collapse.

This implosion drives ordered exclusion zone (EZ) water layers through an outlet nozzle, providing propulsive thrust. The imploded vortex renewal is cyclical, enabling continuous propulsion.

The engine extracts energy from the pressure gradient between coherent EZ layers and bulk water during cavity collapse. The momentum of the focused EZ jet provides tunable bi-directional thrust for underwater or aerospace applications.

Vortex parameters can be optimized for power density and efficiency. The implosion phenomenon generates cavitation shockwaves that may be mitigated via hydrophilic chamber coatings or acoustic management.

By tapping into the kinetic potential of water in its structured EZ state, the vortex propulsion unit could provide an innovative eco-friendly propulsion system. The propulsive pressures achievable exceed conventional systems of comparable size.

Let me know if you would like me to explain any of the other proposed EZ/vortex inventions in more detail. I'm happy to continue providing dedicated overviews for each idea.
