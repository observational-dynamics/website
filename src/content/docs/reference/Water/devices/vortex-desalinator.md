title: Vortex Desalinator
description: A proposed device to separate fresh water from saline water using vortex-induced exclusion zone (EZ) water layers.

The vortex desalination system would separate fresh and saline water by harnessing centrifugal vortex forces. The setup would consist of a cylindrical chamber angled to induce a strong swirling vortex as water enters tangentially.

The vigorous vortex flow would generate an inwards pressure gradient, concentrating the formation of layered ordered exclusion zone (EZ) water structures along the central axis of the chamber. At the same time, the outward centrifugal forces push the salty ions and particles toward the exterior of the swirling flow.

This leads to separation of fresh EZ water concentrated axially at the center, while the saline water gets pressed towards the periphery. The two streams can be extracted through separate outlets - freshwater can be tapped from the inner vortex core, while the outer stream yields brine.

Vortex desalination can be scaled up for municipal or industrial applications by using large chambers and high volume flow rates to maximize the EZ separation effect. The process would avoid using membranes or chemicals like conventional desalination.

By taking advantage of the innate physical separation induced by vortex hydrodynamics, saline and fresh water could be efficiently and sustainably obtained. The technology could help provide potable water in arid coastal regions.
