The EZ water batteries would utilize the charge storage capacity of EZ water to develop high density aqueous batteries. The key component would be pairs of hydrophilic electrode plates immersed in water.

When a charge is applied to the plates, it causes alignment and organization of the water molecules next to the electrode surfaces into layered exclusion zone (EZ) structures. The highly ordered EZ layers have the capacity to store significant electric charge stably over long periods.

Reversing the voltage polarity of the electrodes can then release the stored charge as current flow. This allows the EZ water to act as a rechargeable battery.

The battery cells could be designed in different form factors and capacities. Small button cells for electronic devices could leverage the charge density of EZ layers around nanoporous hydrophilic electrodes.

Larger plate electrodes in water tanks could store huge amounts of renewable energy from solar/wind farms in the form of EZ charge, acting as massive aqueous batteries.

Various electrode materials, plate geometries, and EZ manipulation techniques could optimize performance. But the core operating principle involves tapping into the charge accumulation and ordering properties of water molecules in the exclusion zone state.

EZ water batteries offer an eco-friendly, non-toxic alternative to conventional batteries. And the potential energy density surpasses lithium-ion. With further research, they could provide a revolutionary way to store energy.
