# Trinitarian State Changes

## Introduction

### Trinitarian Transform

The Trinitarian Transform is a set of nine state changes that can be applied to any object. The nine state changes are:

- birth
- growth
- maturation
- decay
- death
- dissolution
- disintegration
- conception
- birth

### Trinitarian Transformations

This corresponds to the nine states of the Trinitarian Transform:

- radiation
- induction
- conduction
- convection
- absorption
- transduction
- decision
- mediation
- radiation

## State Mirrors

Each state change has a mirror state change. The mirror state change is the same state change, but in the opposite direction. For example, the mirror state change of birth is death, and the mirror state change of death is birth.

absorption -> radiation
transduction -> induction
decision -> conduction
mediation -> convection
radiation -> absorption
induction -> transduction
conduction -> decision
convection -> mediation

death -> birth
dissolution -> growth
disintegration -> maturation
conception -> decay
birth -> death
growth -> dissolution
maturation -> disintegration
decay -> conception
death -> birth

## State Change Chains

Each state change has a chain of state changes. The chain of state changes is the state change, followed by its mirror state change. For example, the chain of state changes for birth is birth -> death, and the chain of state changes for death is death -> birth.

radiation -> induction -> conduction -> convection -> absorption -> transduction -> decision -> mediation -> radiation

birth -> growth -> maturation -> decay -> death -> dissolution -> disintegration -> conception -> birth
