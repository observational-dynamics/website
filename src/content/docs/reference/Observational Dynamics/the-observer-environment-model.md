## The Observer-Environment Model

Building upon the thermodynamic foundations, Observational Dynamics represents the subjective observer (O) and its external environment (E) as an integrated system with circular flows of energy and entropy between the systems [1,2].

This models the coupling between observer and environment, with observation emerging from the interface that regulates the energy-entropy exchange. The dynamics of the coupled O-E system determine the observer's subjective perspective [3].

Furthermore, O and E can each be represented as self-organizing systems, with circular flows driving autonomous ordering processes according to interaction patterns [4,5].

Quantifying the interface properties in terms of inductive capacities and impedances enables modeling the pathways from physical interaction to subjective awareness [6].

Mathematically, the coupled equations are:

dUO/dt = PO(t) - FE,O(UO, UE, Z, t)
dUE/dt = FO,E(UO, UE, Z, t)

Where UO and UE are the internal energies of O and E, PO(t) is the replenishment of O's potential over time, and FE,O and FO,E describe the bidirectional energy flow rates, which depend on impedance Z [7].

Different interface properties lead to different subjective experiences of the same environment. This couples inner awareness to external context. The O-E model provides a basis to relate physical dynamics to subjective perspective using the OD framework.

Moving forward, we further formalize the energy flow equations, impedance factors, interface properties, entropy dynamics, and circuit analogies to create a mathematical model bridging experience with dynamics.
