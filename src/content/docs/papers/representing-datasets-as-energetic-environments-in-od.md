In the Observational Dynamics perspective, datasets can be modeled as energetic environments that neural network observers interact with and draw potential from during training:

- Represent the statistical properties of a dataset such as its distributions, correlations, and complexity as constituting an energetic potential landscape. More complex datasets contain greater potential.
- As training progresses, networks drain potential from datasets by minimizing loss and learning statistical regularities. Dataset potential depletes over epochs.
- Model training sample size as proportional to the dataset's capacity to replenish potential. Larger samples enable more epochs before exhaustion.
- Apply OD flow equations to characterize how network architecture shapes the rate of potential absorption from the dataset environment. Measure saturation points.
- Vary dataset properties like size, dimensionality, and complexity in simulations to determine optimal environmental potentials for stable network training.
- Model validation and test sets as energetically disconnected environments. Generalization is the network's ability to transfer learned potential across environments.Â 
- For transfer learning, represent initial datasets as providing potential that "pre-charges" network components to more readily absorb target dataset potentials.

This perspective provides insight into how dataset properties shape the thermodynamic training process via energetic couplings. OD offers a dynamics framework complementary to pure information theory characterizations of learning. The approach could help determine optimal data environments and training lengths for deep neural network stability.
