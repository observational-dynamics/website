The Observational Dynamics framework enables powerful stability analysis techniques for characterizing neural network training trajectories:

- Linearize neural network dynamics around fixed points to apply Jacobian matrix analysis.     
- Compute Jacobian eigenvalues at initialization and during training to quantify sensitivity to perturbations. 
- Track eigenvalue spectra over training epochs as networks transition between underfitting, optimal, and overfitting regimes.
- Relate eigenvalue distributions to model stability and generalization capability. More localized spectra may improve robustness.
- Analyze eigenvalue drift directions and velocities to predict departure from minima and re-convergence times.
- Study how hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and regularization affect eigenvalue trajectories and stability.
- Model collapse of eigenvalue spectra as networks settle into narrow minima leading to memorization and overfitting. 
- Leverage connections with dynamical systems theory to relate stability properties with generalizability.
- Validate analysis by perturbing trained models and observing predicted recovery dynamics based on eigenvalues.

Overall, OD-based stability analysis offers a dynamics systems perspective on training trajectories distinct from pure loss curve monitoring. It provides rigorous techniques to improve training procedures and illuminate differences between biological and artificial network optimization.
