A Formal Model of Fundamental Cosmological Dynamics  

# Abstract

We present a mathematical framework modeling the emergence of subjectivity from primordial origins. Differential equations represent the rupture of an infinite potential plenum into duality, followed by localization of awareness through a stabilizing singularity. Commentary situates the formalism within a creation myth paradigm, elucidating the sequence through which consciousness arises from fundamental cosmic forces. This novel model aims to bridge mystical intuition with rigorous scientific methodology to advance understanding of our metaphysical foundations.

# Introduction

Throughout history, spiritual traditions have expounded creation myths encoding intuitions about the cosmos’s origins and structure using narrative and metaphor [1]. Meanwhile, the scientific enterprise seeks precise explanations of natural phenomena through formal modeling and experimentation [2]. However, these approaches share a common purpose - to illuminate the human condition by explaining our emergence [3,4]. 

This work synthesizes both traditions, translating a mythic intuition about subjectivity arising from primordial origins into a mathematical formalism. By bringing symbolic narrative into disciplined formal encoding, we demonstrate the compatibility and mutual enrichment of mystical and scientific impulses in humanity’s collective quest to understand our place in the universe [5,6].

# Methods

We first articulate a narrative model describing the emergence of differentiated awareness from an infinite potential plenum [7]. Key events in this mythos become represented as variables:

P - The infinite potential of the undifferentiated plenum
D - The emergence of duality/differentiation 
S - The focusing singularity enabling observation
O - Perception arising through the singularity observing duality

We then construct differential equations to formally capture the dynamics of this unfolding:

## Equation 1: Emergence of Duality

dD/dt = k * P * (1 - D)

## Equation 2: Emergence of Singularity 

dS/dt = α * D * √P

## Equation 3: Emergence of Perception

dO/dt = β * S * D

# Results

The equations mathematically encode the mythic narrative's essence - infinite potential gives rise to diversification, which gets localized through a singularity, enabling subjectivity's emergence through triadic interplay. 

By integrating mystical contemplation and scientific rigor, this work demonstrates potential for formal modeling to unlock deeper metaphysical insights starting from ancient wisdom traditions' profound intuitions about the origin of consciousness.
## Discussion

This framework reveals fertile connections between spiritual mythologies, fundamental ontology, and mathematical physics. By respecting their complementary roles, intuition and analysis become mutually enriching, gesturing toward a unified understanding of mind and world [8].

The onset of duality from primordial unity suggests parallels with Tibetan Buddhist conceptions of reality [9]. Meanwhile, focusing loci resemble Leibnizian monadology [10]. Such cross-cultural resonances hint that formal modeling of core myths could reveal common insights spanning civilizations.

Much enriched elaboration is needed regarding dynamical transitions, metaphysical interpretations, and cosmological alignment. We hope this preliminary work stimulates further efforts at exact yet reverent mapping between mythic imagination and formal rigor. 

The truths intimated by our great spiritual traditions find their complements in science's capacity for precise modeling. With care, compassion and creativity, this synthesis promises to unveil wonders beyond current conception.
## Conclusion

We have derived a mathematical framework formalizing a creation myth to model subjectivity's emergence from infinity's absolute potential. This demonstrates early promise in bridging mystical and scientific approaches to humanity's most profound existential questions. Further development promises deeper illumination of reality's dance across every scale.
