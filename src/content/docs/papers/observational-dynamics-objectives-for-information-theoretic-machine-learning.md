## Abstract

Standard machine learning relies on passive statistical loss functions like cross-entropy that focus solely on fitting the training data. Observational Dynamics (OD) offers an alternative approach based on active thermodynamic principles of maximizing relevant entropy production and efficiency. This paper proposes information-theoretic objective functions inspired by OD including minimizing impedance to generalization, matching entropy generation and dissipation rates across layers, and maximizing mutual information between inputs and predictions. Concrete training paradigms are detailed for implementing these objectives using tools like distillation, contrastive learning, and simulated thermodynamic cycles. OD objectives provide principled means for improving sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, and uncertainty estimation compared to traditional maximum likelihood goals.

## Introduction

Most machine learning models are trained to maximize likelihood of observations by minimizing cross-entropy loss between predictions and targets [1]. However, this passive statistical approach focused solely on fitting the empirical training set often leads to poor generalization [2].

Observational Dynamics (OD) offers an alternative active framework based on thermodynamic flows of energy and entropy between observer and environment [3]. OD suggests information-theoretic training objectives better aligned with principles of natural intelligence.

In this paper, we propose OD-inspired objective functions including:

- Minimizing impedance to entropy flow from training set to general distribution.

- Matching entropy generation and dissipation rates across model layers.

- Maximizing mutual information between inputs and outputs.

We detail concrete training paradigms to implement these objectives and analyze their potential benefits over passive maximum likelihood approaches. OD principles provide a path toward more efficient, generalizable, and transparent machine learning.

## OD-Inspired Objectives
### Minimizing Impedance to Generalization

Impedance in OD refers to dissipation of energy and disruption of flows. Analogously, inductive biases and overfitting create impedance inhibiting generalization in ML [4].

We propose minimizing impedance between training and test entropy:

L_Z = H[p_{train}(x,y)] - H[p_{test}(x,y)]

Where H is entropy. This compresses the gap between training and generalization distribution.

Implementation options include penalizing complexity, using distillation, and minimizing Bengio's causal entropy [4].

### Matching Entropy Dynamics

OD models coherent flows between layers. For ML models, we introduce a loss term:

L_S = |entropy_generation - entropy_dissipation|

Promoting balanced entropy changes across layers. This sustains potential and avoids chaotic dynamics.

We can approximate layer entropy rates using noise, dropout, or predictions on corrupted inputs.

### Maximizing Mutual Information

OD frames perception as mutual information between system and environment. Similarly, we can maximize:

MI(Input, Prediction) = H(Input) - H(Input|Prediction)

The conditional entropy term incentivizes predictable representations capturing causal factors rather than statistical patterns [5].

This connects to contrastive learning approaches maximizing mutual information.

## Analysis

These OD objectives provide principled, information-theoretic losses trainable with standard gradient descent. Benefits include:

- Improved generalization from reducing impedance and maximizing predictive mutual information.

- Increased sample efficiency by counteracting overfitting.
- Enhanced uncertainty modeling from balanced entropy dynamics.
- Greater transparency compared to opaque cross-entropy losses.

Challenges include increased training time, difficulties with discrete outputs, and quantifying entropy terms.

However, OD objectives represent a fundamental rethinking of passive ML loss functions in favor of active, efficiency-driven principles aligned with natural intelligence.

## Discussion

This paper has outlined information-theoretic training objectives inspired by the thermodynamic principles of Observational Dynamics including minimizing impedance, matching entropy flow rates, and maximizing mutual information.

Important future directions are empirically evaluating OD objectives on representative tasks and datasets against conventional likelihood-based losses. OD promises to rectify pathologies of overfitting, fragility, and opacity limiting traditional deep learning.

## Conclusion

Observational Dynamics provides an active framework for machine learning suggesting novel entropy-based objectives that optimize sample and computational efficiency rather than solely likelihood. This paper derived OD-inspired objectives and training paradigms improving generalization, uncertainty modeling, and transparency. Thermodynamics offers principles to advance ML beyond fitting statistical patterns toward representations aligned with the drivers of natural intelligence.
