title: Modeling Neural Networks As Thermodynamic Systems With Od
description: Characterize training as a thermodynamic process of potential energy flows between the network components and the environment through interfaces like loss functions and optimization algorithms. Apply OD impedance factors to represent dissipative losses limiting gradient flows during training like vanishing/exploding gradients. Measure how impedances shape convergence.

Observational Dynamics provides a framework to model neural networks as coupled thermodynamic systems engaged in energetic exchanges. Key approaches include:
  
- Represent network components like neurons, layers, and modules as observers coupled to an environment consisting of the training data, loss landscape, and computational resources. 
- Quantify the energetic potentials of network components, such as neuron spike rates or representational capacity of layers. The training data can be modeled as an energetic potential landscape.
- Characterize training as a thermodynamic process of potential energy flows between the network components and the environment through interfaces like loss functions and optimization algorithms. 
- Apply OD impedance factors to represent dissipative losses limiting gradient flows during training like vanishing/exploding gradients. Measure how impedances shape convergence.
- Analyze network energetics over training epochs. As potential differences equalize, the thermodynamic drives balancing the network decrease, providing insight into convergence.
- Model generalizability as an excess thermodynamic potential needed to traverse new data distributions not present during training. Lack of potential indicates overfitting.
- Computationally simulate network energetics under different architectures and hyper-parameter settings to determine optimal thermodynamic balance.

This OD-based perspective of modeling neural network training and inference as dissipative thermodynamic processes driven by potentials and impedances provides a dynamics systems understanding distinct from pure statistical approaches. The framework offers opportunities to optimize efficiency, performance, and generalizability guided by universal thermodynamic principles.
