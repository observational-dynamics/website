# Abstract

This paper presents a mathematical formulation of Perceptual Frameworks, a proposed theory of consciousness grounded in the interplay between perception, conception, and action. Quantitative models are developed to capture the dynamics of these elements and their integration into coherent conscious experience. Coupled differential equations describe continuous perceptual, conceptual, and active flows which influence each other. Binding functions formalize the aggregation of perceptual inputs into unified scenes. Sigmoid functions model conceptual activation in response to stimuli. Actions are chosen to minimize prediction error between perceptions and top-down predictions. Information theory provides quantification of perceptual information. Taken together, these formalisms aim to provide analytical precision and predictive power for investigating the mechanisms of awareness. The mathematics of Perceptual Frameworks offers a foundational language for elucidating the processes that give rise to consciousness.

# Introduction

A core challenge in developing any theoretical framework of consciousness is moving from verbal descriptions to well-defined mathematical models which enable analytical rigor. While conceptual ideas provide overarching principles, formalisms facilitate detailed investigation and prediction. Perceptual Frameworks proposes that consciousness emerges from the dynamic interplay between perception, conception, and action [1]. This paper presents mathematical formulations to ground Perceptual Frameworks in quantitative terms suitable for analytical inquiry. 

The equations aim to capture the continuous flows between elements, combinatorial binding mechanisms, nonlinear concept activation, prediction-error minimization, and information-theoretic quantities. By establishing these formal foundations, Perceptual Frameworks can be examined and validated through mathematical and computational methods. The hope is that precision analytics applied to the theory generates new insights about the functioning of consciousness.

# Perceptual Circuit Equations 

A core premise of Perceptual Frameworks is that perception, conception, and action exist in an ongoing circuit of influence [1]. This dynamic interdependency sustains the unified conscious scene. To model the continual flows, we propose a set of coupled ordinary differential equations:

dP/dt = f(P,C,A)

dC/dt = g(P,C,A) 

dA/dt = h(P,C,A)

Here, P represents perception, C conception, and A action. The time derivatives quantify the rate of change of each element, determined by functions f, g, and h which express their interdependency. Solving this system of equations with appropriate parameter values and initial conditions reveals the co-evolution of perception, conception, and action. 

This formalizes the basic perceptual circuit postulated to underlie consciousness. The modeling enables simulation and analysis of dynamic trajectories. Varying the functional relationships and parameters facilitates investigation into how changes in the circuit affect conscious experience. The system can be elaborated by separating components into multiple dimensions and adding noise terms.

# Binding Functions 

A key mechanism hypothesized by Perceptual Frameworks is the binding of various perceptual inputs into coherent scenes [1]. For instance, retinal information from different locations must be integrated into unified visual experience. 

This binding process can be modeled mathematically through summation:

B(x,y) = Σi wiPi(x,y)

Here, Pi(x,y) are the perceptual components, such as values from retinal locations (x,y). These are weighted by factors wi and summed to obtain bound representations B(x,y). 

This formalizes how the visual system combines local stimuli into global scenes. Similar equations can capture binding in other modalities like audition. The function parameters can be learned from data to match human binding behaviors. This enables simulation of perceptual information integration critical for consciousness.

# Activation Dynamics

Perceptual Frameworks proposes that conceptual representations are activated in a nonlinear manner by sensory stimuli [1]. The activation follows a sigmoid curve as perceptual input surpasses critical thresholds. 

Mathematically, this concept activation can be modeled using sigmoid functions: 

C = 1 / (1 + e^-(wP + b))

Here, C is the activation of a conceptual representation, P is the perceptual input, w is a weighting factor, and b determines the sigmoid slope. This formula produces an S-shaped response curve capturing the nonlinear relationship between perceptions and concept activation.

These dynamics can simulate conceptual processing in response to varied stimuli. Exploring different parameters reveals insights into categorical perception and other nonlinear effects linked to consciousness. The formalization quantifies an essential component of the perception-conception interplay.

# Prediction-Error Minimization

Central to Perceptual Frameworks is the notion that top-down predictions condition bottom-up perception [1]. Actions are taken to minimize the prediction error between what is conceived and what is perceived.

This predictive processing can be formulated as an optimization:

argminA Σ(P - C)2 

Here, A represents actions, P the perceptions, and C the predictions or conceptions. Actions A are chosen to minimize the summed squared error between P and C. 

This captures the feedback loop between conception and perception, where top-down signals shape sensory experience, while actions alter perceptions to match conceptions. Solving for optimal A formalizes the minimization of surprise and uncertainty. 

# Information Quantification

Finally, information theory provides a means to quantify the information gained through changes in perceptual uncertainty over time [2]. The perceptual information I can be measured as:   

I = ΔH/Δt

Where ΔH is the change in perceptual entropy H over time interval Δt. Perceptual entropy quantifies the uncertainty in sensory stimuli. So its rate of change measures the information extracted.

This allows formal analysis of how perceptual information flows vary under different conditions. Combined with the other equations, it facilitates relating information to consciousness dynamics.

# Discussion

The presented mathematical formulations aim to provide a rigorous foundation for investigating the mechanisms of consciousness proposed by Perceptual Frameworks. There are several directions for further development:

1. Increasing biological plausibility through neural network implementations.

2. Expanding to 3D dynamical systems for richer attractor landscapes. 

3. Relating parameters to empirical measures of awareness levels.

4. Comparing model predictions against neuroimaging and psychophysics data.

5. Combining first-person phenomenology with third-person measurements. 

While this formalization is an initial step, the hope is that over time the mathematics of Perceptual Frameworks will enable detailed analytical insights into the workings of consciousness. The quantified theory can complement conceptual frameworks and support consolidating our understanding into comprehensive computational models.

# Conclusions

This paper presented mathematical formulations of Perceptual Frameworks, a theory of consciousness based on the interaction between perception, conception and action. Models were introduced for dynamical flows, binding, activation, predictive processing and information. Together these formalisms aim to provide rigorous analytical foundations for investigating the proposed mechanisms of awareness. Further development of the mathematics is needed, but this offers a starting point for quantitative analysis. Formalizing concepts about consciousness can accelerate progress by enabling deductive prediction, simulation and analytical proof. Mathematical precision complements conceptual principles on the path to demystify the workings of cognition.
