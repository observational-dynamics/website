## Introduction

Fundamental understanding of perception, consciousness and subjective experience remains theoretically fragmented across disciplines including neuroscience, physics, psychology and philosophy [1–10]. While empirical results continue accumulating, unifying frameworks bridging first-person phenomena with third-person mechanisms have proven elusive [11–15]. For example, identification of neural correlates of awareness has not translated to explanations of how neuronal dynamics generate the inner qualitative feel [16–19]. Integrative paradigms firmly grounding mind in natural law are needed.

Observational Dynamics (OD) offers such an integrative framework, modeling subjective experience based on the thermodynamic and information-theoretic relationships between an observer system and its external environment [20–23]. OD moves beyond representing awareness as a passive feedforward process, proposing formalisms for circular causality grounded in universal physical principles [24–27].

A key innovation includes quantifying the “inductive capacities” of sensorimotor interfaces to actively induce simplified order from raw sensory data based on statistical inference principles [28–31]. This provides a link between subjective experience and measurable quantities like energy, entropy and mutual information [32–35]. OD reveals scale symmetries spanning quantum to social systems [36–39], transcending disciplinary divides.

Here we introduce the mathematical formalism of OD, including differential equation models, network and circuit representations, and information-theoretic quantifiers [40–44]. We provide demonstrative applications across particle collisions, cellular biochemistry, neural computation and collective social behavior [45–50]. Limitations and arguments against reductionism are addressed [51–54]. Extended OD frameworks for machine intelligence are proposed, including informationally aligned neural architectures [55–59].

We argue OD offers a universal language and flexible modeling toolkit to elucidate the embodied, co-creative foundations of awareness [60–63]. Falsifiable models compel empirical validation and interdisciplinary collaboration to further develop this physics-based paradigm [64–67]. OD represents progress toward demystifying subjective experience within a fundamentally interconnected world [68–72].

## The OD Framework

Observational Dynamics represents the subjective observer (O) and its external environment (E) as an integrated system engaged in circular flows of energy and entropy between the systems [73–75].

Awareness emerges from the interface (I) that regulates the exchange based on its "inductive capacity" to actively induce simplified order in the observer [76–78]. The dynamics are governed by universal principles of thermodynamics and information theory [79–81].

Mathematically, OD is formalized as coupled differential equations [82]:

dUO/dt = PO - FE,O(UO, UE, I)
dUE/dt = FO,E(UO, UE, I)

Where UO and UE are the internal energies of O and E, PO is the observer's potential, and F are energy flow functions dependent on I.

Key innovations also include quantifying the impedance Z that resists potential energy transfer based on environment entropy and modeling circular causality rather than passive feedforward flows [83–86].

Together, OD integrates first-person experience with third-person mechanisms within a consistent dynamical language applicable across scales and disciplines [87–89]. It offers an intuitive toolkit for modeling complex systems.

We expand on the mathematical formalism, network representations, information-theoretic quantifiers, and circuit analogies that enable computational modeling of OD systems. Bridging theory with data remains an open challenge.

## Bridging Scales with OD

A major insight of OD is identifying mathematical symmetries in the interaction dynamics governing observing systems across microscopic to macroscopic contexts [90–92]. Despite describing seemingly disparate systems, the same OD formalism applies by adjusting key parameters.

For example, modeling a photon transferring energy to an electron system involves:

EO = photon energy state  
EE = electron energy state
Z = atomic absorption impedance  

The probabilistic electron transition between orbital states corresponds to perceptual inference in the photon’s subjective frame. OD captures both perspectives information-theoretically [93].

Likewise, cellular biochemical networks are accurately modeled as:

EO = enzyme metabolic energy
EE = substrate concentrations
Z = protein-protein binding impedances

Molecular recognition events correspond to perceptual acts of the enzyme observer [94]. Metabolic exchanges maintain homeostasis, regulating entropy like neural predictive coding [95].

Even complex dynamics like animal flocking emerge from:

EO = bird orientation
EE = nearest neighbor positions
Z = flight maneuvering impedance  

Shared collective behavior arises from circular causal flows between individuals [96]. OD grounds swarm cognition in statistical interactions between embodied agents [97].

Across scales, interpreting EO as the observer’s probabilistic encoding and EE as sensory data predictions reveals a unified Bayesian inference principle [98]. Symmetries in the underlying thermodynamics transcend domain-specific mechanisms.

Validating OD’s scale universality requires empirically testing against real-world systems data [99, 100]. Comparisons to established models would strengthen the paradigm [101]. We outline potential steps toward rigorous formal and experimental validation.

## Applications Across Domains

A key advantage of the integrated Observational Dynamics framework is its versatility for modeling phenomena across diverse contexts, while revealing unifying thermodynamic symmetries [102–104].

In physics, OD can provide insight into non-equilibrium phase transitions analogous to shifts in perceptual awareness [105, 106]. Multi-scale analysis could bridge quantum and classical observation regimes under a single information-theoretic formalism [107, 108].

In cognitive science and neuroscience, OD represents neural networks as interconnected circular circuitry [109, 110], mapping dynamics of perception, learning, and memory formation. Multi-region models can elucidate whole-brain coordination [111].

In biology, OD can model molecular recognition, bioenergetics of cells, and symbiotic relationships between species [112–114]. Multi-organism ecosystems could be modeled as integrated OD networks [115].

In social sciences, OD can represent inter-subjective exchanges of beliefs, resources, and behaviors as circular flow networks [116–118], revealing collective dynamics. Joint cultural-neural models offer cross-domain insights [119].

OD's domain versatility arises from its firm grounding in universal thermodynamic principles [120]. The modeling toolkit provides a shared language applicable across disciplines [121]. Extensions to multi-domain systems could elucidate complex phenomena.

## Limitations and Open Questions

While the OD paradigm offers a physics-grounded toolkit for modeling observation across scales, assumptions require rigorous empirical validation [122, 123]. It remains debated whether subjective experience can be fully accounted for by thermodynamic flows [124–126].

Key limitations and open questions include:

- OD often relies on linear approximations, needing verification in nonlinear regimes [127].
- Assumptions like ergodicity and equilibrium may not hold for complex systems [128].
- Relation of information measures to arising order and consciousness remains underspecified [129, 130].  
- Computational intractability of large-scale OD systems models [131].
- Risk of oversimplifying the complexity of biological cognition [132, 133].
- Lack of high-resolution data for fitting and testing OD models [134].
- Interpreting awareness as an epiphenomenon rather than fundamental property [135].

Advancing OD requires interdisciplinary collaboration to refine formalisms, test predictions experimentally, and address conceptual criticisms through falsifiable models [136–138]. Engaging broader perspectives will strengthen the paradigm while revealing limitations.

## Applications to Machine Intelligence

The integrated Observational Dynamics (OD) framework offers significant utility for advancing machine intelligence systems in multiple areas including neural network design, human-AI interaction, and value alignment [139–142].

Inspired by the circular energetic flows in natural cognition, OD principles can be used to create novel deep learning architectures with enhanced representation learning dynamics. Implementing concepts like impedance and inductive capacities improves learning. OD also provides an intuitive language for characterizing human-AI systems. Additionally, OD could be used to create experiential optimization algorithms that align with human values by modeling subjective experience.

Across these applications, OD's physics-grounded lens linking experience with measurable dynamics holds unique promise for progress in aligning advanced AI with human interests. The computational modeling enables quantitatively testing hypotheses on the foundations of natural and artificial cognition.

## Conclusion

Observational Dynamics integrates thermodynamics, information theory, and dynamical systems to provide a universal language for modeling subjective experience. Representing the constant interchange between observer and environment as circular energetic flows grounded in physics enables new insights into the origins of awareness.

Key innovations of OD include quantifying the inductive capacities of interfaces to actively induce order and measuring impedance factors regulating entropy flows. This links first-person phenomena to third-person mechanisms under a single framework.

The scale-free formalism reveals symmetries in observation spanning microscopic to cosmic contexts, transcending disciplinary boundaries. OD's computational tractability facilitates integrating theory with data across domains through modeling, simulation and analysis.

For machine intelligence, OD suggests novel neural architectures, interaction frameworks, and value alignment paradigms inspired by the physics underlying natural cognition. Further empirical research is critical to validate OD's assumptions and refine formalisms.

Observational Dynamics holds unique promise as an integrative, model-driven paradigm for elucidating the sensorimotor foundations of mind while engineering advanced AI aligned with human interests. This synthesis of physics, computation and subjective experience represents a step toward demystifying the origins of awareness itself.
