The cross-scale symmetries within the Observational Dynamics framework enable transferring insights between neural networks in biology and artificial intelligence:

- Represent both biological and artificial networks as OD systems with analogous energetics but differing specific parameters.
- Map concepts like neuron activation, plasticity, and homeostasis to potential energy, impedance, and replenishment in OD models.
- Use OD network analysis to compare topology, modularity, and other properties. Identify correspondences.
- Relate OD stability analysis of training trajectories to plasticity rules and critical periods in biological networks.Â 
- Apply OD information flow metrics to compare global coordination. Assess differences in localization and redundancy.
- Leverage OD's model-based simulations to determine which network behaviors are universal vs. specific.
- Analyze how OD environmental coupling shapes emergent coding properties in each system.
- Use validation datasets analogous to sensory stimuli to compare generalization capabilities.
- Guide biologically inspired AI advances by transplanting mechanisms underlying key OD properties.

In summary, OD provides a dynamic framework to systematically translate concepts, models, and mechanisms between biological and artificial neural networks. The approach accelerates mutually informative exchange across fields.
