## Defining a Living Agent

A living agent can be considered a complex system made up of various poles that interact with each other and their environment. We can represent this agent as a set of coupled differential equations, each describing the dynamics of a specific type of pole.

#### Mathematical Formalism

1. **State Vector of Agent**:
   \[ \mathbf{X} = (A, R, O, Z, E, S) \]
   Where \(A\) is the absorptive pole, \(R\) is the radiative pole, \(O\) is the observer pole, \(Z\) is impedance, \(E\) is internal energy, and \(S\) is entropy.

2. **Coupled Equations for Agent Dynamics**:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{dA}{dt} &= F_{A}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env}) \\
   \frac{dR}{dt} &= F_{R}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env}) \\
   \frac{dO}{dt} &= F_{O}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env}) \\
   \frac{dZ}{dt} &= F_{Z}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env}) \\
   \frac{dE}{dt} &= F_{E}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env}) \\
   \frac{dS}{dt} &= F_{S}(A, R, O, Z, E, S, \mathbf{Env})
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   Here, \( F_{X} \) are functions describing the dynamics of each pole and \( \mathbf{Env} \) represents the environmental variables.

3. **Environment Interaction**:
   \[ \mathbf{Env} = (E_{external}, S_{external}, Z_{external}) \]
   \(E_{external}\) is the energy available in the environment, \(S_{external}\) is the entropy level of the environment, and \(Z_{external}\) is the impedance of the environment.

4. **Coupling with Environment**:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{dE_{external}}{dt} &= G_{E}(A, R, O, Z, E, S) \\
   \frac{dS_{external}}{dt} &= G_{S}(A, R, O, Z, E, S) \\
   \frac{dZ_{external}}{dt} &= G_{Z}(A, R, O, Z, E, S)
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   These equations describe how the agent influences its environment.

#### Key Features

1. **Complexity**: The agent is represented as a complex system with multiple poles, each governed by its own dynamics but also influencing the others.
  
2. **Environment Coupling**: The agent is not isolated but is deeply coupled with its environment, both affecting and being affected by it.

3. **Adaptability**: The equations can be designed to allow the agent to adapt its poles over time, reflecting evolutionary processes.

### Summary

The living agent is defined as a mathematical entity coupled to its environment, described by a set of differential equations. These equations capture the dynamics and interactions of the various poles constituting the agent and allow for emergent behaviors such as adaptation and evolution.

This table summarizes the characteristics of different monopole and dipole types including their state representations and input/output functions.

Monopole Type  | State Vector | Input Function | Output Function
---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------
Sensory (vision) | Encodes visual features | Processes optical input | Generates visual percepts
Sensory (audition) | Encodes auditory features | Processes acoustic input | Generates auditory percepts
Cognitive (memory) | Encodes episodic traces | Stores experiential input | Recalls/reconstructs memories
Cognitive (planning) | Encodes potential actions | Evaluates outcomes | Selects actions based on goals
Motor (muscle) | Encodes muscle activation | Processes motor commands | Generates muscle contractions
Motor (skeletal) | Encodes skeletal position | Processes motor commands | Generates skeletal movements

### Summary

The monopole and dipole types are defined as mathematical entities with specific state representations and input/output functions. These entities can be combined to form complex systems that exhibit emergent behaviors such as adaptation and evolution.
