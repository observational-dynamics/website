title: Composite Multi-Agent Systems
description: Composite multi-agent systems. A composite multi-agent system is a collection of agents that work together to achieve a common goal. The agents can be homogeneous or heterogeneous, and can be trained independently or jointly. The agents can be trained using reinforceme

## Methods

## Distributed Architecture

- Each GPT-2 model runs independently on separate hardware nodes in a distributed architecture. This allows concurrent parallel processing.
- A central controller coordinates the models by routing inputs and outputs between them.
- Communication protocols like gRPC can connect the nodes. Load balancing handles model distribution.

### Modular design

- Break down the agent into logical modules (e.g. syntax, semantics, conversation etc). Assign specialist GPT-2 models to each module.
- A core module integrates the outputs of other modules into a unified response.
- Inter-module APIs and schemas allow seamless integration.

### Ensemble Methods

- Run multiple GPT-2 models with different hyper-parameters/training data.
- Aggregate their outputs through ensembling approaches like weighted averages or voting.
- Improves robustness over single models.

### Hierarchical Chaining

- Arrange models in a hierarchical DAG with lower level models feeding higher level ones.
- Allows building up complexity from simple modules.
- High level models integrate richer understanding of context.

### Evolution

- Evolve a population of agents with different GPT-2 model arrangements through selection and mutation.
- Fitness based on coherence of agent's responses.
- Allows discovering ideal architectures

### Unified Model

- Merge parameters from all models into a single large GPT-2 model.
- Add module/task specific markers in input schema.
- May run into size and overfitting issues.

The overall architecture combines aspects of the above, tailored to requirements. The key is seamless integration of specialized modules into a unified agent interface.

## using ensemble methods to create a composite multi-agent system with multiple GPT-2 models

- Multiple GPT-2 models can be independently trained on the same data using different hyper-parameters (e.g. number of layers, attention heads, batch size etc) or on different subsets of the data.

- During inference, the same input is fed to all models and their outputs are aggregated using an ensemble technique:

- Simple Averaging: Take an unweighted average of model outputs.
- Weighted Averaging: Assign weights to each model based on validation performance. Higher weight to better performing models.
- Bayesian Model Averaging: Use Bayesian inference to estimate weights by treating them as probabilities.
- Stacking: Feed model outputs as features into a meta-learner to generate the final output.
- Voting: Models vote on the output; majority vote wins.

- Ensemble methods improve robustness and stability compared to single models.
- Weights can be dynamically adjusted to give higher influence to models specialized for the current context.
- Multiple ensemble combinations can be maintained to generate diverse outputs.
- Redundancy in models provides fault tolerance if some models fail.
- Challenges include training complexity, inference cost, and reconciling inconsistent outputs.
- Careful tuning of ensemble architecture, hyper-parameters, and combination method is required for optimal performance.

In summary, ensembling provides a robust approach to integrate outputs from a collective of GPT-2 agents into a unified multi-agent system.

## Example Python code

Here is some example Python code to illustrate a basic implementation of an ensemble of GPT-2 models:

```python
# Train multiple GPT2 models with different hyperparameters/data
model_1 = GPT2Model(hparams={...}) 
model_1.train(data_1)

model_2 = GPT2Model(hparams={...})
model_2.train(data_2) 

# Dictionary to hold models  
models = {'model_1': model_1, 'model_2': model_2}

# Model weights based on validation performance
weights = {'model_1': 0.6, 'model_2': 0.4} 

# Ensemble prediction function
def ensemble_predict(input_text):

  # Get individual model outputs
  output_1 = models['model_1'].predict(input_text)
  output_2 = models['model_2'].predict(input_text)
  
  # Weighted average ensemble  
  combined_output = weights['model_1']*output_1 + weights['model_2']*output_2
  
  return combined_output

# Sample usage  
output = ensemble_predict("Hello world")
print(output)
```

This shows:

- Training models separately
- Storing them in a dictionary
- Assigning heuristic weights
- Making weighted ensemble predictions

In practice, the models, combination logic, and weights can be much more sophisticated. But this demonstrates a simple ensemble approach.

This shows an end-to-end neural approach, with separate nets for each module integrated through a meta-learner. The environment is also a neural model trained along with the agent through RL. Many enhancements are possible here as well.
