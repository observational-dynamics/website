The Bio-Inspired EZ Reactor aims to boost reaction rates, yields, and selectivity by structuring reactors to organize reagents into exclusion zone (EZ) layers.

It utilizes microfluidic reactor designs containing hydrophilic vortex chambers and other architectures conducive to inducing EZ formation during reactions.

As reagents flow through the structured reactors, vortex motions and hydrophilic interactions prompt the organization of water and dissolved molecules into ordered EZ zones.

This bio-inspired structuring increases interactions and collisions between the oriented reagents compared to isotropic diffusion. Chemical and biochemical reactions can proceed faster and more efficiently within the layered EZ regions.

The reactors also separate EZ product zones to prevent backward reactions. Precise geometries and vortex flows continually generate fresh reactive EZ interfaces.

Overall, the Bio-Inspired EZ Reactor aims to transpose biological architectures that leverage EZ effects into engineered reactors, upgrading chemical synthesis through structured water dynamics.
