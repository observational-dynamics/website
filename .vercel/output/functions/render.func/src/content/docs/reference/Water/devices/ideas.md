Vortex hydroelectric generator - Converting the energy from water vortices into electricity using charge separation in EZ layers.
EZ water batteries [ez-water-batteries.md]- Exploiting the charge storage capacity of EZ water to make high density aqueous batteries.
Vortex desalination - Using centrifugal vortex motion to separate fresh EZ water from saline water.
EZ water supercapacitors - Constructing high-surface area carbon electrodes to create large EZ zones for energy storage.
Vortex mixing heat pump - Utilizing vortex motion to generate EZ layers that rapidly absorb heat for heating or cooling.
EZ water filtration - Flowing water tangentially over hydrophilic surfaces to create EZ exclusion zones that filter particles.
Biological EZ generators - Using enzymes or cytoskeletal proteins to generate EZ layers for biological energy harvesting.
Vortex propulsion engine - Imploding vortex chambers to propel EZ coherent water layers for thrust.
EZ water lubricant - Exploiting the layered structure of EZ water to reduce friction in mechanical systems.
EZ water seeding - Using EZ water layers as nucleation sites to promote rain formation in clouds.
Bio-inspired EZ reactor - Structuring reactors with hydrophilic vortex chambers to promote EZ-enhanced reactions.
EZ water crop spraying - Coating plants with EZ layers allows more efficient water and nutrient absorption.
