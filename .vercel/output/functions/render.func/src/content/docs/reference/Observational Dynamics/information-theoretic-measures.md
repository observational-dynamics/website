## Information Theoretic Measures

Information theory provides powerful quantifiers for analyzing Observational Dynamics systems across scales [1-3]. Key measures include:

Entropy: Quantifies disorder/uncertainty in a system. For an observer O:

S(O) = -∑p(oi)log(oi)

Where p(oi) is the probability of O being in state oi. Higher entropy implies greater unpredictability.

In OD systems, observer and environment entropy changes reveal dynamics:

ΔS(O) = ΔQ/T(O)
ΔS(E) = -ΔQ/T(E)

Where ΔQ is heat transfer and T is temperature. Interface properties regulate entropy flows [4].

Mutual Information: Measures shared signal between observer O and environment E [5]:

MI(O,E) = ∑p(o,e)log(p(o,e)/p(o)p(e))

Where p(o,e) is their joint probability. MI quantifies learned couplings.

Relative Entropy: Divergence between internal model M and external environment E [6]:

D(M||E) = ∑pM(e)log(pM(e)/pE(e))

Changes in these measures relate to emerging order, coordination, and collective behaviors in OD systems [7-9]. Connecting physical entropy flows with information metrics provides deep insights.
