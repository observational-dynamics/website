## Thermodynamics of Observation

A key premise of Observational Dynamics is representing the subjective observer and its environment as thermodynamically coupled systems engaged in the exchange of energy and entropy. This bridges the observer's internal, subjective experience with measurable physical variables [1,2].

The second law of thermodynamics states that isolated systems evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium, minimizing free energy. However, an observer maintains itself in a low-entropy state distinct from its surroundings by constantly dissipating potential free energy accumulated from metabolic, cognitive, or other processes [3].

This potential energy discharge into the environment, coupled to impedance factors which will be elaborated shortly, constitutes the act of observation within the OD framework. It is associated with entropy changes in both the observer and environment [4,5].

Furthermore, incorporating the principles of self-organization into OD frames perception and consciousness as auto-catalytic processes arising from the co-creative interplay between observer and environment [6,7].

Quantitatively, the thermodynamic dynamics can be derived from the differential equations for an open dissipative system [8]:

dUo/dt = Po(t) - (dUe/dt + dW/dt)

Here Uo and Ue are the internal energies of the observer and environment respectively, Po represents the potential energy replenishment of the observer, and dW/dt is the power dissipated by impedance.

This models observation as a continuous process of potential energy discharge and entropy exchange between systems, aligning with the subjective experience of perceiving a dynamically changing environment.

The thermodynamic formalism provides rigorous grounding for the OD framework while opening modeling opportunities across disciplines dealing with flows of energy, matter, and entropy [9].
