description: A proposed device to generate electricity from flowing water using vortex-induced exclusion zone (EZ) water layers.

The vortex hydroelectric generator would harness the power of vortices in flowing water to generate electricity. It would consist of a turbine chamber that would induce and concentrate vortex motion in the water flow.

The chamber walls would be made of a hydrophilic material to promote the formation of ordered exclusion zone (EZ) water layers. As water flows through the chamber, the vortex motion would cause the water molecules to become aligned in layered hexagonal structures, creating extensive EZ zones along the chamber walls.

The vortex flow would also cause charge separation, with an excess of electrons accumulating in the EZ layers compared to the bulk water. This charge difference sets up an electrical potential gradient between the EZ water and the bulk water.

Electrodes or conductive channels would be built into the chamber walls to connect the EZ layers with the opposite end of the potential gradient. This would allow electrons to flow from the negatively charged EZ layers through the conductive system to the positively charged bulk water region.

The stream of electrons moving through the conductive system can then be harvested to generate an electric current. This electricity could be used to power devices or fed into the grid.

The generator could be designed for different scales - small units for home power generation harnessing energy from household water lines, or larger turbines installed in rivers, dams or oceans to produce more electricity. The vortex motion amplifies the EZ effect to maximize power output.

By leveraging the unique properties of EZ water that emerge under vortex motion, the generator aims to provide a new method of harnessing energy from water flow in an ecologically safe and renewable manner. The proposed mechanism of vortex-induced EZ structuring remains to be validated, but offers an innovative bio-inspired approach for potential hydropower applications.
