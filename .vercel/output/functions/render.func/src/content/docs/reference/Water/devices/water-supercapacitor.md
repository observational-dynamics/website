description: A proposed device to store electricity in the form of charge separation in exclusion zone (EZ) water layers.

The EZ water supercapacitors would utilize nanostructured porous carbon materials to generate extensive exclusion zone water layers and achieve exceptionally high capacitance energy storage.

The electrodes would be composed of high surface area carbon such as graphene foam or carbon nanotubes, providing an intricate hydrophilic pore structure. When immersed in water, this maximizes contact between the conductive material and water molecules, facilitating extensive EZ formation along the pore surfaces.

Applying an electric potential difference causes charge separation, with positive ions accumulating on one electrode surface and negative ions oriented in EZ zones on the opposite electrode. This stores energy in the electric field between the oppositely charged electrodes.

The nanoscale pores coated with ordered EZ water thereby immensely increase the effective surface area for charge storage. In effect, the entire volume of water-filled pores can participate as part of the capacitor thanks to the layered EZ structure trapping charges.

In addition, the carbon electrodes exhibit electrical double layer capacitance. This combines with the EZ capacitance to further amplify charge storage capacity.

The result is an aqueous supercapacitor with exceptional energy density, rivaling lithium-ion batteries, while leveraging inexpensive, non-toxic materials. The design could enable rapid capture of regenerative braking energy in electric vehicles or grid-scale storage of renewable energy.
