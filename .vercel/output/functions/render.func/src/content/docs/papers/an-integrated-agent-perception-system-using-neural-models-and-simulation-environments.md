## Abstract

This paper presents an integrated agent perception system combining neural models and virtual simulation environments to enable more comprehensive and persistent subjective experiences for artificial agents. Our approach couples multimodal transformer architectures with interactive Unity-based simulations to ground subjective perceptions from visual inputs while maintaining a persistent environmental memory.

## 1. Introduction

Enabling artificial agents to have rich, grounded subjective experiences remains an open challenge in artificial intelligence research. While recent progress in deep learning has led to powerful generative capabilities, most current systems lack comprehensive perceptual models and struggle to maintain persistence over time. However, emergent capabilities like imagination, emotion, and empathy emerge from the interplay between sensory perception, internal states, and persistent memories accumulated through interaction.

To work towards artificial general intelligence that exhibits complex cognitive capabilities, we need to develop more integrated architectures that combine perceptual modules, internal models, and persistent memory grounded in interactive environments. Specifically, existing work on visual perception models [1], large language models [2], psychology of imagination [3], and virtual environments [4] provide promising components that can be integrated in a comprehensive framework.

In this work, we propose such an integrated agent perception system that couples multimodal neural modules with virtual simulation environments. Our architecture utilizes a visual perception model to generate initial textual scene descriptions from image inputs. These are then processed by an "inner-outer" model framework [5] consisting of two separate language models to balance subjective internal states and grounding in physical reality. The inner model injects imagination, emotion, and other internal representations into the perceived descriptions, while the outer model evaluates consistency with the physical context.

To augment internal grounding, we incorporate a vector store knowledge base [6] that enables querying based on the contextual descriptions. Finally, an interactive Unity-based simulation environment [7] provides persistent state and memory externalization. This environment model receives actions from the agent to manipulate objects, updating the physical state accordingly over time.

Our integrated framework provides a more complete basis for artificial agents to have persistent embodied experiences grounded in virtual environments. In the following sections, we detail the related work, system architecture, implementation, experiments, and results towards realizing such an agent perception system. The introduced techniques provide building blocks for continuing research on artificial imagination, emotion, and memory.

## 2. Related Work

There are several key areas of research that provide relevant context and foundation for our integrated agent perception system. In this section, we review related work in visual perception models, language models, memory and imagination, virtual environments, and relevant psychology frameworks.

### 2.1 Visual Perception Models

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing multimodal machine learning models that can generate textual descriptions from visual inputs. Approaches such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) [8] and Oscar (Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training) [9] leverage large datasets to learn robust alignments between image feature representations and associated text captions. For instance, CLIP is trained on over 400 million image-text pairs from the internet to predict which caption goes with an image, while Oscar incorporates object tags and other semantic labels in addition to captions for enhanced grounding. Such image captioning models provide a key building block for enabling textual perception of visual environments for artificial agents. They allow generating initial scene descriptions from rendered simulation states.

### 2.2 Language Models

Foundation models such as GPT-3 [10] have exhibited strong few-shot learning capabilities and semantic understanding of language simply through pre-training on large corpora of textual data. For instance, GPT-3 attain state-of-the-art results on many NLP datasets without task-specific fine-tuning. Leveraging such models as a basis for language understanding and generation provides a pathway for endowing artificial agents with complex linguistic processing skills. Large transformer-based language models can contextualize perceived textual descriptions in our framework.

### 2.3 Memory and Imagination

There has been growing interest in developing neural network models that exhibit capacities for memory and imagination. For instance, the work by Hinton et al. on Differentiable Neural Computers [11] explores compositional external memory and imagination in neural networks. Through matrix operations, these models can learn to store context-based memories and reimagine/manipulate them in inventive ways. Such differentiable memory mechanisms and imaginative recombination provide a basis for endowing artificial agents with subjective experiences driven by internal states. Our inner model builds on these capabilities for imagination and memory-based scene manipulation.

### 2.4 Virtual Environments

To enable artificial agents to have persistent, interactive experiences, platforms like AI Habitat [12] allow full simulation of 3D virtual environments. Habitat consists of a modular library for configuring embodied AI agents and simulated worlds where the agents can navigate and perform various tasks. The platform supports realistic visual rendering, physics, and spatial understanding. These persistent simulated worlds provide a key capability for grounding the experiences and interactions of artificial agents over time. Rather than static perceptual inputs, virtual environments like Habitat allow bidirectional interactions that shape the states of the world.

### 2.5 Psychology Frameworks

In addition to the technical research areas above, our work also draws inspiration from psychological theories related to imagination and its interplay between bottom-up perception and top-down internal knowledge. For instance, Sarbin's Contextualist theory [13] emphasizes this reciprocal interaction between sensory experiences and internal narrative construction. By modeling both external perception and internal subjective modification, our architecture aims to capture this dynamic interplay.

### 3. Proposed Approach

Our overall system architecture comprises four key modules working together to enable grounded, persistent subjective experiences for artificial agents: multimodal perception, inner-outer models, vector knowledge base, and interactive environment simulation. In this section, we provide an overview of each component and their integration.

### 3.1 Multimodal Perception

The perception module ingests visual inputs from the environment simulation and generates textual scene descriptions. Specifically, we leverage recent image captioning models like CLIP [8] and Oscar [9] that align image regions and object tags with descriptive captions. These models are trained on large datasets to generate contextual textual representations of visual inputs. For instance, Oscar incorporates object detections, attributes, and relationships in addition to full scene captions for richer grounding. We adapt such models by fine-tuning on our specific simulation environments and vocabulary for greater relevance. The perceptual captions provide an initial descriptive understanding of the simulated scenes.

## 3.2 Inner-Outer Models

To process the perceived textual captions, we utilize an inner-outer model framework with separate transformer-based models [15] handling the inner and outer roles. The inner model injects subjectivity into the descriptions, modifying them based on internal state. For instance, the inner model may alter descriptions to be more positively or negatively valenced based on simulated emotions and goals. The outer model serves to ground these modified descriptions by evaluating plausibility and consistency with reality. It acts as a counterbalance to the inner model's subjectivity.

The inner model is pretrained on imaginative narrative corpora and fine-tuned on situational simulations to learn productive subjective modifications grounded in common sense. The outer model is trained for entailment and coherence analysis to assess plausibility. We also apply additional training techniques like data augmentation [16] to enrich and stabilize learning.

## 3.3 Vector Knowledge Base

To augment the conceptual grounding of the generated descriptions, we incorporate a vector knowledge base. This module, implemented using sentence embedding models like SentenceBERT [14], indexes large commonsense corpora into semantically encoded vectors. At runtime, the perception-modified captions are similarly encoded into vectors and used to query the knowledge base. Relevant conceptual knowledge is retrieved to provide additional context and details about the described scenes. This improves holistic understanding and imagination by connecting with broader common sense.

## 3.4 Interactive Environment

Finally, a key aspect of our approach is an interactive simulated environment built using a modular platform like Unity or AI Habitat [12]. The environment model implements physically realistic settings like homes with persistent object states. At each timestep, the model renders an image observation and outputs an objective state description. The visual observations drive the multimodal perception model. The textual state descriptions provide supervised training signals.

The environment also receives action commands from the agent, facilitating interactions that dynamically change the simulation state over time. This grounding of the experience into an interactive persistent world is essential for continuity, embodiment, and memory.

# 4. Experiments and Results

## 4.1 Experimental Setup

To evaluate our integrated architecture, we devise a comprehensive experimental framework with quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis.

All models are implemented in PyTorch using the HuggingFace Transformers library for easier integration [17]. The interactive environment is built in Unity with a Python API.

## 4.1 Perception Model

We select CLIP as the base image captioning model and fine-tune on COCO Captions plus our synthesized simulation datasets. The model is trained for 10 epochs using AdamW optimizer with a cosine decay learning rate schedule from 1e-5 to 1e-7 and batch size 64. We evaluate on SPICE, CIDER, and WMD for caption quality.

## 4.2 Inner-Outer Models:

The inner model initializes from T5-Large pretrained on the BIG benchmark [18]. This is tuned for 10 epochs at 1e-4 learning rate on our situation simulation data for imagination. The outer model starts from RoBERTa-Large and is trained on SNLI and MultiNLI for entailment accuracy. We use a 80-10-10 train-dev-test split and early stopping with a patience of 3 epochs.

## 4.3 Knowledge Base

We leverage SentenceBERT with stsb-roberta-large architecture pretrained on SNLI and STS Benchmark. The index is built using FAISS for fast nearest neighbor search based on cosine similarity. We tune the retrieval threshold based on development set performance.

## 4.4 Environment Simulation

The Unity environment is configured with a bedroom scene with interactable object states. A Python API wraps access and visualization. Physics parameters are tuned to stabilize training.

For quantitative evaluation, we measure overall captioning accuracy on COCO, imagination coherence using human judgments, plausibility of modified captions using entailment accuracy, and knowledge base context precision.

Qualitative assessments involve human-judged naturalness of generated captions, relevant knowledge recall, and evaluating imagination creativity. We also visualize module attentions for insight into model focus.

# 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel integrated agent perception system combining multimodal neural models and interactive simulation environments. The proposed architecture aims to address limitations of subjective grounding and persistence in artificial agents.

Our approach leverages modular components including visual perception models, inner-outer transformer networks, vector knowledge bases, and Unity engine environments. We detailed the foundations, architectures, and planned training methodologies for realizing these modules.

Furthermore, we outlined a comprehensive experimental framework with both quantitative and qualitative evaluations to assess the integrated system capabilities. Detailed testing procedures were described covering all modules and their connections.

However, the implementation and empirical evaluation of the proposed system remains as future work. This paper has focused on introducing the high-level approach and design specifications. The concrete system development and experimental findings validating the architectures will be conducted subsequently.

Once completed, we plan to publish a follow-up paper documenting the full implementation details, training learnings, evaluation results, and any architectural refinements. This will demonstrate the real-world feasibility of the proposed techniques and quantify their benefits for enabling imaginative, persistent, and grounded subjective experiences in artificial agents.

The current work has laid the theoretical foundations and experiment plans for this ambitious system. We look forward to constructing the models, performing empirical assessments, and sharing the results in an upcoming publication.
