The integrated structure of Observational Dynamics lends itself naturally to network representation and analysis techniques. This enables studying how information flows through neural network architectures:

- Represent network layers and modules as nodes in an OD network model. Connections between layers become links with associated energetics.
- Characterize the potential energy of nodes as representational capacity. EDGE values can quantify mutual information between nodes.
- Model forward and backward passes during training as directional potential energy flows along OD network links.
- Analyze path lengths, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients and other OD network metrics to find bottlenecks limiting end-to-end information flows.
- Study how network depth, width, and connectivity patterns distribute or concentrate flows based on OD network symmetries and impedance.
- Use OD community detection algorithms to analyze emerging subsidiaries in self-supervised and multi-task models.
- Apply OD motivations analysis to identify underutilized nodes and redundant links that can be reparameterized for greater efficiency.
- Relate OD network metrics to model performance. For example, greater network integration may improve generalization capability.

In essence, OD network modeling provides a dynamics systems perspective on how network architectures shape emergent properties like distributed representations. The approach can guide design optimizations and illuminate differences between biological and artificial neural networks.
