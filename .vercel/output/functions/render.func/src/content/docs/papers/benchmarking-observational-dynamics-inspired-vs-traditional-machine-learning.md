## Abstract

Mainstream machine learning models excel at pattern recognition but exhibit fragility, opacity, and inefficiency. Observational Dynamics (OD) offers physics-grounded alternatives emphasizing active inference and information flows. This paper proposes comparative benchmark tasks and metrics for evaluating OD-inspired vs traditional models. Aspects include sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, uncertainty estimation, transparency, and embodied interactive learning. Initial small-scale explorations demonstrate advantages of OD-aligned architectures and objectives on perception-related tasks. Larger studies are needed for comprehensive comparisons. Establishing rigorous benchmarks will spur progress onObservable Dynamics as a path toward robust, human-aligned machine intelligence.

## Introduction

Observational Dynamics (OD) models perception and cognition based on thermodynamic principles of circular energetic exchanges between observer and environment [1]. Integrating these concepts into machine learning has potential to improve robustness and sample efficiency compared to traditional passive statistical approaches [2].

However, systematic comparative studies are needed. We propose benchmarks for contrasting OD-inspired and mainstream models across:

- Sample complexity on vision, language, and sensorimotor tasks.
- Out-of-distribution generalization.
- Uncertainty estimation.
- Interpretability of learned representations.
- Transfer learning abilities.
- Interactive embodied learning.

We outline sample tasks and evaluation metrics in each area. Initial small-scale explorations demonstrate advantages of OD architectures and objectives. Establishing rigorous comparative benchmarks will drive progress on positioning OD as an alternative paradigm for human-aligned machine intelligence.

## Tasks and Metrics

### Sample Efficiency

Training on reduced data highlights OD benefits. We propose classification tasks on Vision (MNIST, CIFAR), audio (speech commands), and simple robotic control with limited samples. Metrics include accuracy, precision/recall, and entropy of learned representations.

### Generalization

Testing on shifted distributions stresses generalization. Useful datasets include perturbed images, synthetic linguistic variations, and simulated dynamics different from training. Metrics measure stability of accuracy, confidence calibration, and entropy gap between domains.

### Uncertainty Modeling

Uncertainty estimation is key for robustness. Useful tasks involve noisy images, incomplete text, and decision-making from partial observations. Log-likelihoods, confidence intervals, and entropy estimates quantify uncertainty quality.

### Interpretability

Understanding representations aids transparency. Proposed techniques include saliency maps for vision/language, disentanglement metrics, and architecture analyses. Measuring embedding dimensionality and aligning to conceptual factors supports interpretability.

### Transfer Learning

Transfer tests versatility. Useful tasks transfer between image domains, text genres, and related control policies. Measuring accuracy from fine-tuning vs re-training contrasts transferability.

### Embodied Interactive Learning

Active OD paradigms should excel where agent-environment interaction enables efficient exploration. Proposed tasks include responsive vision systems, interactive language acquisition, and developmental robotic benchmarks requiring motivation-driven learning.

## Analysis

We have conducted small studies on sample efficiency, finding OD models generalize better from limited data. OD training principles confer advantages, but further optimization is needed.

Larger studies across proposed task suites will rigorously contrast OD and traditional approaches. We hypothesize consistent OD benefits on efficiency, generalization, uncertainty modeling and embodiment due to its alignment with thermodynamic drivers of perception and learning.

Improved interpretability arises naturally from OD's information-theoretic objectives. Transfer abilities may be mixed, as OD representations emphasize specificity over modular reuse. Comparisons will delineate strengths and limitations on both sides.

Establishing reproducible, rigorous benchmarks for contrasting OD and mainstream machine learning is essential for spurring adoption and impact of this alternative paradigm.

## Discussion

This paper has outlined task suites and metrics for benchmarking Observational Dynamics-inspired machine learning against traditional approaches. Key challenges include designing controlled experiments and implementing performant OD models.

While initial studies show promise, extensive comparisons are critical for validating the potential of OD principles to overcome limitations of passive statistical learning. Benchmarking will elucidate trade-offs and help refine OD theory and implementations toward human-aligned artificial intelligence.

## Conclusion

Observational Dynamics offers a path to improving machine learning through information-theoretic, physics-based principles. This paper proposes benchmarks on efficiency, generalization, uncertainty, interpretability and embodiment for comparing OD-inspired and traditional models. Rigorous empirical contrasts will drive progress on establishing Observational Dynamics as a generative paradigm for aligning machine intelligence with natural cognition.
