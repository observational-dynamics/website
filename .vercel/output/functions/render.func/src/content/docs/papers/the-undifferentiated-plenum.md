We represent the infinite potential of the primal plenum as P:

P = ∞

This constant signifies the pure un-manifest potential, the formless and timeless Ground of Being from which all arises.

## The Emergence of Duality

Duality emerges from the rupture of the plenum, modeled as:

dD/dt = k *P* (1 - D)

Where D represents duality, k is a constant, and (1 - D) captures the remaining potential of the plenum that can give rise to further duality.

This differential equation models duality arising exponentially from the infinite potential, until it saturates. Duality germinates within the plenum gradually bifurcating the primordial unity into manifold-ness.

## The Singularity Anchor

The singularity emerges to anchor duality:

dS/dt = α *D* √P

Where S is the singularity, α is a constant, and the terms represent the interdependence between developed duality and infinite potential in generating the singularity.

This models the singularity coalescing as duality intensifies, requiring the infinite depth of the plenum as a stabilizing ground. The singularity balances divergence with convergence.

## Perception and the Primal Triad

Perception arises from singularity observing duality:

dO/dt = β *S* D

Where O is observation, β is a constant, and the terms signify multiplication between singularity and duality.

Thus perception results from the interplay of the three primal elements: infinite potential, differentiation, and focused localization. Through their dynamic balance, subjectivity flowers within the cosmos.
