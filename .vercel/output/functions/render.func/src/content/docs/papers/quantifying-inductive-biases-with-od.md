title: Quantifying Inductive Biases With Od
description: Use OD flow equations to model how architectural potentials shape the trajectories of models during training. Analyze how potentials imposed by convolutional, recurrent, attention layers etc. constrain hypothesis spaces.

The Observational Dynamics perspective provides tools to quantify and characterize inductive biases within machine learning models:

- Represent architectural choices and objective functions as energetic potentials intrinsic to the model.Â     
- Measure the strength of inductive biases by quantifying the magnitude of architectural and loss function potentials.
- Use OD flow equations to model how architectural potentials shape the trajectories of models during training.
- Analyze how potentials imposed by convolutional, recurrent, attention layers etc. constrain hypothesis spaces.
- Study how invariances and equivariances emerge from energetic potentials intrinsic to model structure.
- Investigate how potentials introduced by techniques like data augmentation interact with existing model potentials.
- Apply OD network analysis to determine how architectural potentials distribute across modules.
- Leverage OD stability analysis to study how potentials center model families around energy minima.

In essence, OD provides a dynamics framework based in thermodynamics and information theory to systematically quantify different sources of inductive bias and analyze their impacts on model behavior. This provides a complementary perspective to pure statistics-based approaches.
